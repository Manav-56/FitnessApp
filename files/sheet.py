# Clean Code Cheat Sheet

# 1) Be consistent
# Used either ' ' or " " throught out the application develpoment. I used " " for this application

# 2) Naming Conventions
# variable should be nouns_in_lower_case
# CONSTANTS should be NOUNS_IN_ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES
# functions should be verbs_in_lower_case
# classes should be CamelCase

# 3) Add relavant comment, just for code more readlable.

# 4) Add meaningful name for funcation,class, and varaibles.

# 5) Use constants to avoid repeating the same code again and again.

# 6) Create simple test cases for better understanding as compared to one complicated test case.

# 7) Opening files in a block with "with" has the advantage that the file gets automatically closed when leaving the code block.

# 8) Use Library
# whenever there is a library available; that can make your project easier.
