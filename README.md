# FitnessApp

An App that aids in Health Maintenance 

## Exercise A for Advanced Software Engineering

### General
A Fitness Application is found in this repository. That user can assess their BMR(Basal Metabolic Rate), BMI(Body Mass Index), and track their calories depending on activity levels, as well as a wide range of dietary ingredients such as protein, carbs, fat, sugar, and vitamins. Furthermore, this software makes their lives easier, particularly in terms of health.

## Exercise B for Advanced Software Engineering

### 1 Git

I used Git to commit and publish my work to GitHub on a regular basis, and I did everything in my IDE (PyCharm), regularly uploading my code to GitHub through IDE. My git timings can be viewed on the GitHub contribution chart.

### 2 UML

For this application, I produced three separate UML diagrams. If colors are used, green indicates that these features will be implemented. The purple hues indicate that the function has been activated.

- Characterize the system's dynamic characteristics An [Activity Diagram](https://github.com/Manav-56/FitnessApp/blob/main/Docs/Activity%20Diagarm.png) is essentially a flowchart that depicts the flow from one activity to another.

- A [Use Case Diagram](https://github.com/Manav-56/FitnessApp/blob/main/Docs/Use%20Case%20Diagram.png) is a visual representation of a user's potential interactions with a technology.

- A [State Diagram](https://github.com/Manav-56/FitnessApp/blob/main/Docs/State%20Diagram.png), it describes the state of the components as well as state changes caused by an event.


### 3 DDD

I created a [problem space](https://github.com/Manav-56/FitnessApp/blob/main/Docs/DDD_Problem_Space.png) with several subdomains that needed to be implemented for the project.  As shown in purple color that part already has  been implemented, , while others will be implemented in the future, as shown in gree color n, once I will  receive the investment from Edlich.


### 4 Matrics

I utilized SonarQube, which automatically analyzes the submitted source code based on various criteria. SonarQube is an open-source tool for continuous code quality inspection that does automated inspections with static code analysis to find bugs and code smells, as well as many other Matrices.

I've included a screenshot of the [SonarQube](https://github.com/Manav-56/FitnessApp/blob/main/Docs/SonarCubeActivity.png) dashboard that describes several matrices for this application.
